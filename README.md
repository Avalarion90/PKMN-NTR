# PKMN-NTR
A Generation VI Pok√©mon games real-time editing tool for use with NTR CFW. Discuss this tool on [GBATemp](http://gbatemp.net/threads/wip-pkmn-ntr-pok%C3%A9mon-gen-6-memory-editor.441892/).

# Remote controls
In order to use the remote controls you need to install the InputRedirection CIA: https://github.com/Kazo/InputRedirection, to use it, after loading NTR CFW open the CIA to patch the HID moudle and that's all.
If you're interested in bot functionality, check out [drgoku282's fork](https://github.com/drgoku282/PKMN-NTR) of this program.
